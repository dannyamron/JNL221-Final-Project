        <h3>A History of Discriminatory Policies</h3>
        <p>When local politicians sought funding from the federal government to construct the Interstate 81 viaduct through Syracuse’s 15th Ward, they destroyed most of the city’s Black community according to the <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/campaigns/i-81-story">NYCLU</a>. The construction of the viaduct resulted in more than 1,300 families being forced to relocate, and it redirected economic investment and tax dollars away from the city center and toward the increasingly white suburbs. Many of those who had to relocate following the viaduct’s construction wound up moving to the south of where it then stood.</p>

        <p>The NYCLU added that the viaduct advanced the already existing patterns of segregation and poverty in Syracuse, with the city currently being one of the ten most segregated metro areas in the United States.</p>

          <h3>How the Divide Maifests Itself Today</h3>
          <p>Through an analysis of city property data, nine of the top ten neighborhoods with the highest percentages of vacant properties are located west of the I-81 viaduct. The only one to the east of the viaduct is the Near Eastside, which partially aligns with where the 15th Ward previously existed. The Southwest neighborhood holds the highest percentage of vacant properties at 40.9%, followed by Franklin Square with 39% and the Near Westside with 36.9%. The citywide average vacant property percentage by neighborhood is 16.4%.</p>

          <p>Timur Hammond, an associate professor of geography at Syracuse University, said that there are three key reasons he sees as creating this disparity: histories of disinvestment or underinvestment dating back to the redlining policies of the 1920s and 1930s, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s and 1960s that destroyed large parts of the city and solidified practices of underinvestment and the legacy of predatory real estate practices and property tax policies.</p>

          <p>“If we look at patterns of development in Syracuse right now, primarily being driven by real estate development at the upper levels of the market, whether that's luxury student housing or kind of catering to business professionals,” he said. “So I think it's a reason why you see lots of real estate development right along Genesee near the university, and especially in downtown. But again, a reason why you don't see investment in these kinds of more impoverished areas along 81 and the Near Westside and the Near Eastside.”</p>

          <p>Through those practices that lead to underinvestment or disinvestment, Hammond said, landlords often see walking away from a deteriorating property and letting the city eventually foreclose it as more profitable than continuing to pay property taxes on it. These patterns lead to uneven investment, and subsequently, where the money and profits flow throughout the city, he said.</p>

        <h3>The Impacts of the Disparity</h3>
        <p>These disparate patterns of investment have the potential to increase the number of vacant properties, which can extrapolate out into a larger negative-feedback loop for investment and economic growth in these communities, Hammond said.</p>

        <p>“I think vacant properties can signal a lack of investment and upkeep in the neighborhood,” he said. “So particularly homes that are allowed to decay become a drag on the rest of the neighborhood, in the sense of it lowers property values for people who do on their own their homes because people ghost that neighborhood which then, in turn, reduces the amount of equity that they're able to generate to maintain the neighborhood in the first place.”</p>

        <p>Hammond also said another argument, which he believes should be taken with a grain of salt, is that vacant properties can become sites of “marginal social activities” as well. However, he said he has seen examples of vacant properties becoming places of common use with common upkeep too.</p>

        <p>However, with the <a href="https://www.syr.gov/Departments/Planning/Planning-Initiatives/ReZone-Syracuse">ReZone Syracuse</a> project on the horizon, he does not think that it will bring about meaningful changes to the policies and practices that created the current socioeconomic and geographic divide in the city.</p>

        <p>“A big question with zoning and rezoning, in particular, has to do with how does the city, how do elected officials, how do developers, how do residents, find a workable definition of best possible good,” Hammond said. “So oftentimes when zoning conversations happen, both city officials and developers argue that the best use of land is the use of the land that generates the highest profit. But the problem is when you look at development, only through the lens of maximizing return on investment, that tends to negatively impact already marginalized communities.”</p>

        <p>To counter these engrained practices and policies, Hammond said a radical proposal would be to “just give people housing or give people property” to create more equitable situations in urban communities instead of pushing out marginalized peoples that are already forced to live in public housing.</p>

        <p>But he recognizes that such a solution is not likely on the horizon.</p>

        <p>“I think that solution is probably too radical for Syracuse to entertain, but it is, I think, a valid and important kind of alternative to think about,” he said.</p>
